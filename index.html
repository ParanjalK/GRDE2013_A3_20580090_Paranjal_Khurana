                <video width="700vw" height="500vw" controls>
                    <source src="images/step1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                  </video>
                <p> To get started, you'll need your roll of shot film, the Paterson 
                  Tank kit with all included parts except for the agitation tool, film spools, 
                  a pair of scissors, a darkbag or darkbox (can be susbstituted
                  for a darkroom or a room in your house which you can light seal 
                  into a makeshift darkroom), a set of pliers (only if you're 
                  developing 35mm and don't have the tongue of the film roll out) 
                  and a clean space to work in. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Place everything inside the darkbag/box/room and make sure no light 
                  enters that area. You want to start by taking out all the film from the 
                  canister. If the tongue is not out already, you'll need to pince the top 
                  cap of the canister, twist inwards towards the centre of the spool and pull 
                  to remove. Now you can take the plastic spool out and all the film should be 
                  wrapped around. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Take the end of the film and cut the tongue off so both sides of your end of 
                  film have sprokets. You will now feed this onto the spools. Before doing this 
                  in the dark, I would strongly recommend practicing with some developed film or 
                  sacrificing a roll to practice in a lit room since the tools you'll be using in 
                  the dark can be dangerous if not handled with care. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  If you're developing 120 film, life is lot easier in some ways and not so much 
                  in others. Remove the little piece of paper in the middle that holds it all together 
                  and remove all the backing paper as well. Eventually, you will reach a stiffer part 
                  which is where the film begins. Unroll all of this away from the backing paper and 
                  you will reach a long piece of masking tape attaching the end of the film to the backing 
                  paper. Try to gently remove the masking tape without bending the film but if it doesn't 
                  come off cleanly, you can opt to cut the join between the tape and paper or tear it.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Once you've fed all the film onto the spools, put the spool onto the black centre piece 
                  and place base side down into the Paterson Tank. Place the inner funnel cover piece on top 
                  and twist to secure in place. You'll hear a distinct 'click' sound when it's locked. The lid 
                  can be placed on top but isn't necessary since the tank is now light sealed. You can now 
                  remove them from the bag and turn the lights on if you wish.

                    <source src="images/step2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                  </video>
                  <p> For the next step in the process,  we'll begin by washing the film. You can use the 
                    pressure film washer by attaching it onto your tap or do some manual agitation by turning
                    the tank around. Wash twice and rinse well. Try to get as much of the water out as you can
                    before pouring in the developer as to not dilute the developer solution unnecessarily. Before
                    you pour in the developer, it is important to check the temperature of the solution. Depending
                    on whether you use a 1:1 dilution of developer to water or develop with stock solution instead,
                    it is important to check the development time for the film stock you are processing and to know
                    what temperature to compensate for in the developing process. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you have your temperature and time, pour the developer in and secure the lid of the tank
                    firmly. Agitate continually for the first minute and then for ten seconds every minute until 
                    development time is over. Don't agitate harshly and try not to "shake" the tank as this may 
                    create bubbles which can stick to the film and lead to uneven development. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When putting the tank down after agiatation, it is good practice to tap the tank firmly on your 
                    working surface to ensure all the bubbles you may have created rise to the top of the solution and 
                    pop. Once develpoment timer has reached 30 seconds (you have 30 seconds development time left on the 
                    clock), remove the lid and pour developer into chemical waste container.

                  </video>
                  <p>Once you've poured the developer out, development time should be nearing its end and you can begin to 
                    pour your stopbath solution into the tank. We're using Ilfostop which only requires 30 seconds when used 
                    fresh but please refer to the instructions on the chemistry you use to get accurate timings for each procedure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once the required amount of time has passed, you can pour the stop solution into an airtight bottle for later use 
                    or dispose of it into the waste container. After stopbath, you must rinse your film so as to not contaminate your 
                    fixer. Rinse well two to three times to make sure all the stopbath has been removed from the tank.

                  <p>Now your film is developed but the images on the negative will still not be visible and the film is still sensitive 
                    to light. To fix the image onto the film and create a negative, the film must pass through a fixer solution. Mix your 
                    fixer solution as instructed on the bottle and using the times recommended by the manufacturer, fix your film.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We're using Ilford Rapid Fixer diluted 1:4 with water which fixes film in 2 minutes when used fresh. Note that you may 
                    want to increase your fixing times as your working solution ages and becomes more contaminated with silver. Agitate for 
                    ten seconds every 30 seconds and remember to tap to remove bubbles. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pour your fixer into an airtight bottle for future use or dispose into a waste container.

                  <p>Now that the film is fixed, you can remove it from the tank. It needs to be washed extremely well. You can choose to do 
                    so in the tank or after removing it from the tank but remember to rinse it well and remove any and all fixer from the firm. 
                    If you fail to do so properly, the fixer remaining on the film will slowly corrode it over time. Same goes for your tank and 
                    other equipment so remember to always wash well.

                  <p>Once you're sure you've rinsed all the fixer off, it's time to dilute washaid with 1:200 parts water and clean the film so we 
                    can hang it to dry. Washaid is a mild detergent which helps remove any remaining chemicals from the film and helps it dry straight 
                    and streak free. This step is optional but recommended since if you simply wash your film with water and hang it to dry, you may 
                    end up with water stains on your film or even worse, fixer stains which discolour the negative making it very difficult to scan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once rinsed in washaid, remove film from spools by disassembling the spool and hang to dry. Paterson clips are recommended since they 
                    come in packs of two where one is weighted and the other is not meaning you can clip the light one on top and the heavy one on the bottom 
                    to keep your film straight throughout the drying process. Hang somewhere with little to no dust and little activity so the film can dry 
                    without getting in your way and/or attracting dust which can potentially scratch the film.

                <p>Last but not least, it's time to clean everything. Make sure you clean all the equipment and your working surface with some sort of cleaning 
                  solution. wipe up all spills and leave to dry. If you've spilled anything on the floor, mop it up and remember to cap your waste container.

                  Chemicals should be stored at 20 degrees celsius. You can refrigerate them in the summer if you need and create a hot bath for them to bring them up 
                  to approx. 20 degress when you need to use them.

                  Once your film is dry, there are a few ways of scanning it. From DSLR scanning to flatbed, many options for scanning your film at home exist but if 
                  you wish to leave it up to the prfessionals, take your film to a local lab and they can scan it for you. Otherwise, you have another rabbit hole to 
                  explore. DSLR scanning is the one with the best results but does require quite a hefty investment but if you have a digital camera already, it can be 
                  a great way to scan film at home. Try it out!
